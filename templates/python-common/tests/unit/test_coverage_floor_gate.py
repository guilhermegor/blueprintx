"""Unit tests for the coverage-floor omit gate (``bin/check_coverage_floor.py``).

The should-PASS cases matter as much as the should-fail ones: a gate exercised only on what
it rejects has been shown to reject, not to discriminate. The one that carries the whole
point of issue #149 is ``test_widened_omit_swallows_new_capability_logic_is_flagged`` — the
synthetic probe that proves the floor actually notices when ``omit`` widens past its
legitimate scope, since the real template ships only the already-excluded example capability
and therefore finds nothing to flag on its own.
