"""Unit tests for the per-layer import gate (``bin/check_layer_imports.py``).

Every case is built from a shape **measured in a real project**, not invented: a vendor at the
top of ``model/``, the same vendor deferred into a function under an ``ImportError`` guard, and
pandas called as an API rather than named as a type.

The should-PASS cases matter as much as the should-fail ones. A gate exercised only on what it
rejects has been shown to reject, not to discriminate — and this gate's whole design rests on a
distinction (annotation vs API) that a blunter rule would flatten.
