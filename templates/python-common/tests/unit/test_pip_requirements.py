"""Unit tests for the pip-fallback requirement translator (offline; no pip, no network).

**No shipped tier exercises the case these tests exist for**, and that is exactly why they
are here. Every skeleton declares ``[tool.poetry]``, so the equivalence probe that guarded
the heredoc extraction — five tiers x four group selections — could not see a PEP 621
project at all, let alone one declaring *only* ``[project.optional-dependencies]``. That
shape sent the selector down the Poetry path and emitted nothing, and the caller wrote the
nothing to ``requirements-lock.txt`` where it reads as "this project has no dependencies"
(blueprintx#211).

So the fixtures below are hand-built rather than lifted from a tier: the bug lives in the
layouts the repo does not ship, which is the half no amount of running the real thing can
reach.
