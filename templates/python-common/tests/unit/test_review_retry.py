"""Unit tests for the rate-limited-review retry (``bin/retry_rate_limited_review.py``).

The whole design rests on one measurement, so the tests are organised around what that
measurement licenses and what it forbids:

- Licensed: re-ASKING when the reviewer said it was rate limited. Measured upstream over 112
  PRs — 19 hit a rate limit and 18 were reviewed in the end, so the state is a delay.
- Forbidden: letting any of this influence a VERDICT. blueprintx#259 established that a
  reviewer notice's text cannot decide whether a PR was reviewed, because the "already
  reviewed" footnote is appended to every outcome. The rate-limit phrase does discriminate
  (0/25 performed, 0/3 failed, 57/59 not-completed), but this module still only ever asks for a
  review — never passes one.

So the load-bearing test here is the negative one: a PR with **no review at all and no notice**
must not be re-asked into looking healthy, and one whose reviewer merely *reviewed older code*
is not a rate-limit case either.
