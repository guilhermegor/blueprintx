"""Unit tests for the function-length gate (offline; no git, no network).

**The negative control is the point.** A gate nobody has seen fail is indistinguishable from
a gate that is not wired up, and this one is easy to break silently: a discovery glob that
stops matching, a metric that quietly subtracts too much, an `ast` walk that misses nested
functions. Every test below either proves the gate FIRES on something it must reject, or
pins one measured reason it must NOT fire — the docstring exclusion above all, since without
it the ceiling would punish exactly the documentation habit this project mandates everywhere
else.
