"""Structural gate: an arithmetic read-modify-write race on an ORM-loaded row (blueprintx#385).

THE SHAPE THIS GATE CATCHES — row 1 of #385's decidability table, and *only* row 1::

    record = session.get(Product, product_id)     # or query(Product).filter(...).first()/.one()
    record.stock = record.stock - quantity         # or record.stock -= quantity
    session.flush()

Under ``READ COMMITTED`` (the default in both PostgreSQL and MySQL) two concurrent callers can
both read ``stock == 1``, both decide there is stock, and both write. Nothing crashes, nothing
logs, both transactions commit — the number is silently wrong. The fix is a property of the
CODE SHAPE (push the arithmetic into the ``UPDATE``, or lock/version the read), not of the
transaction, which is exactly why a reviewer scanning for ``BEGIN``/``COMMIT`` never sees it.

WHY ONLY ROW 1. #385 is explicit that row 2 — "read an entity, assign an attribute, flush, with
no lock" — is NOT gated: every ORM ``update()`` in existence reads then writes, so firing on
that shape is 100% noise. This gate fires only when the assigned value is an ARITHMETIC
expression over the SAME attribute read moments earlier — the one form a reviewer cannot catch
by eye, because ``x.qty = x.qty - n`` reads as obviously correct.

WHAT IS FLAGGED, and what silences it, within the SAME function:

1. a variable bound to a single-row ORM read — ``session.get(Model, id)`` or a
   ``<query>.first()``/``<query>.one()`` chain that also calls ``.query(Model)`` (the ``.query``
   call is what pins a model onto the chain and rules out an unrelated ``.first()`` on a plain
   list — the false-positive risk #385 calls out explicitly for the wider "any read then write"
   shape);
2. that variable's attribute reassigned (``=`` or an augmented op) FROM AN EXPRESSION THAT
   REFERENCES ITS OWN PRIOR VALUE — ``x.attr = x.attr - n`` or ``x.attr -= n``;
3. with no ``with_for_update()`` on the read (a chained call, or the ``with_for_update=`` kwarg
   on ``session.get``) and no ``version_id_col`` on the model's ``__mapper_args__`` — checked
   against a same-file class definition; a model defined elsewhere cannot be resolved by this
   structural gate and relies on the lock check or the escape hatch below.

⚠️ MEASURED ZERO INSTANCES IN templates/ TODAY (#385) — and that does not disqualify the gate.
``templates/`` ships example code a generated project copies and extends; the subject is what a
downstream project WILL write against a stock schema, not what is present here now, the same
anticipatory-allowlist reasoning ``codespell:ignore`` already relies on with zero occurrences.

ESCAPE HATCH, required reason, same shape as ``dtype-ok:``/``complexity-ok:`` elsewhere in this
file family — a single-writer migration script legitimately does read-modify-write::

    record.stock = record.stock - n  # rmw-ok: single-writer offline migration, no contention

A bare marker with no reason does not satisfy the gate.

NOT GATED HERE, by design (#385): a missing ``CHECK (… >= 0)`` (deciding which columns are
quantities is a naming heuristic — ``check_comment_language.py``'s first draft was 19 findings,
18 false, from exactly this kind of guess) and whether a given read-modify-write is actually
contended (a batch job and a checkout endpoint look identical in the AST). Both are docs, not a
gate — see the DB-layer ``CLAUDE.md`` this issue's docs half (PR #387) added.

WIRING (blueprintx#385): pre-commit only, in this file's own ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` — NOT
CI. The CI workflow (``.github/workflows/scaffold_checks.yml``) is held by an unrelated open PR
(#286) at the time this gate shipped; adding a job there is left for that PR's owner rather than
widening this change's surface. Not run over BlueprintX's own tree either: this repo has no
``src/`` (it is a Make + bash scaffolding tool, not a Python application), so a root invocation
would discover zero files and, by this gate's own zero-discovery guard, fail every commit for a
reason no one could fix by editing code here — the same reasoning ``lint_deps.sh`` documents for
staying scoped to a generated project.
