"""Enforce that ``.coveragerc``'s ``omit`` list never swallows a capability's real logic.

``fail_under`` in ``.coveragerc`` is the coverage floor this repo already ships. That floor is
only honest if the ``omit`` list beside it is accurate — and ``omit`` is exactly the shape of
hand-declared list this repo distrusts: nobody can contradict it. Widen one glob (turn
``src/capabilities/*/infrastructure/*`` into ``src/capabilities/*``) and a whole new
capability's domain/application logic drops out of the denominator. ``fail_under`` still
reads 80, the suite is still green, and the layer CLAUDE.md calls "pure Python, no I/O" is
no longer measured at all — green, silent, wrong.

The floor here is CODE-derived, not a second hand list: for every capability under
``src/capabilities/`` that ``.coveragerc`` does not name outright (the single literal,
non-wildcard exclusion — today ``example_feature``, the shipped example — read straight out
of the same ``omit`` list, never hardcoded), walk its ``domain/`` and ``application/`` layers
via ``ast`` and collect every module that defines at least one function. That set is what
"real logic" means structurally: an enum-only file (``domain/enums.py``, the other declared
exception) defines classes but no functions, and is correctly excluded without a second rule
about it. Any file in that set matched by an ``omit`` pattern is the floor's finding.

⚠️ **Coarse is the decision, not a lapse.** This floor works at the capability root: it
catches a NEW capability's logic being wildcard-omitted wholesale. It cannot catch a single
mis-omitted file inside a capability that already has narrower, legitimate exclusions —
closing that gap would mean deriving coverage expectations file-by-file, which is exactly
the fragile, hand-maintained map this gate exists to avoid needing.

A fresh scaffold ships exactly one capability (``example_feature``), which the omit list
already names outright, so the derived "must stay covered" set is empty and this gate has
nothing to check yet. That is the expected result, not a broken detector — the synthetic
probe in the test suite is what proves discovery works before a second capability exists.
