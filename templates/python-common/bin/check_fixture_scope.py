"""Flag a non-function-scope pytest fixture in ``tests/`` without a written reason (#442).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Test order dependence is a RUNTIME property — it is about execution order
and the state a fixture leaves behind, and no static tool can see either. `pytest-randomly`
(wired alongside this gate) is the real detector: it shuffles order and makes a hidden
dependency fail, sometimes only under a particular seed. But a shuffle is also flaky BY
DESIGN — a bad order might happen not to be drawn, so the finding can surface days later in
an unrelated PR and read as CI flakiness rather than a real defect.

THIS GATE IS A PROXY, NOT A PROOF. It cannot detect order dependence — that would require
running the suite. What it CAN decide, from source alone, is the cheapest and most common way
independence gets broken by accident: a fixture whose `scope=` is widened from the default
(`"function"`) to `"module"`/`"class"`/`"session"`/`"package"`. A wider scope means the fixture
instance — and anything it mutates — is SHARED across tests, which is exactly the shape a
`get`-depends-on-a-prior-`post"` bug takes. Measured at the time this gate was written (see
blueprintx#442): every fixture across `templates/python-common/tests/` and every service
tier's `tests/unit/conftest.py` was already function-scoped — a clean baseline this gate exists
to PIN, not remediate. Nobody had chosen that; nothing recorded it. The first `scope="module"`
anyone adds would have removed the protection silently, in a diff that reads as a performance
improvement.

NOT decidable, and deliberately not attempted: whether a widened scope is actually SAFE (a
read-only fixture that mutates nothing is fine at any scope). That needs the same judgment a
human review already provides — the escape hatch below is exactly that judgment, written down.

THE ESCAPE HATCH: a `# fixture-scope-ok: <reason>` comment anywhere from the `@pytest.fixture`
decorator line through the `def` line (inclusive), with a non-empty reason — the same shape as
`# complexity-ok: <reason>` (`check_complexity.sh`) and `test-change-ok: <reason>`
(`check_assertion_weakening.py`) elsewhere in this repo.

Every finding is a hard error (exit 1). Discovery is `tests/**/*.py` under `--root`; zero files
found is itself a failure (see `audit_paths`) — the same vacuous-pass guard every gate in this
family carries (blueprintx#111).
