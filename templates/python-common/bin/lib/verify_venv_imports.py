"""Verify the target venv can actually import what pip claims it installed.

Used by ``bin/lib/pip_fallback.sh`` right after a pip-fallback install. "``.venv``
exists" and "``pip install`` returned 0" both stop short of the question that actually
matters: can this interpreter import what was just declared? Neither probe catches a
blocked corporate index that leaves an empty ``.venv`` behind while still reporting
success, nor a batch install pip calls "already satisfied" without ever touching the
index (blueprintx#127 — "two probes that lie"). Left unguarded, the failure surfaces
layers away, as a bare ``ModuleNotFoundError`` the first time the project actually runs.

Must run under the TARGET venv's own interpreter, not the bootstrap one — only that
interpreter's ``importlib.metadata`` sees the venv's site-packages.

Interface: a requirements file path as ``argv[1]``, one requirement per line (as written
by ``pip_requirements.py``). Exits non-zero, naming every requirement whose distribution
is missing or whose recorded top-level module fails to import; exits 0 (nothing to
verify) when the file has no requirement lines — an intentionally dependency-free group
is not a failure.
