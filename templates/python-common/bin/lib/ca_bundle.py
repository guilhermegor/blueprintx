"""Build a UNION CA bundle: the corporate proxy CA plus everything already trusted.

Used by ``bin/lib/bootstrap.sh::build_union_ca_bundle`` on networks behind a TLS-inspecting
proxy. Reads ``BX_CA_CORPORATE`` (the proxy's certificate) and ``BX_CA_OUT`` (where to
write), prints the number of certificates written, and exits non-zero rather than producing
a bundle that would narrow the host's trust.

⚠️ WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A HEREDOC. It lived inside a shell function as a
``"$PYTHON" - <<'PYEOF'`` block: six lines of shell wrapping ~66 lines of security-relevant
Python that ruff never linted, mypy never checked, and no unit test could import. It is
covered behaviourally through the shell seam by
``tests/integration/test_bin_scripts.py::test_corporate_ca_bundle_is_a_union_not_a_replacement``
and its refusal sibling, which is why extracting it is verifiable rather than hopeful.

THE INVARIANT THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP: a bundle containing only the corporate CA is a
REPLACEMENT wearing the word "union". Writing one would narrow the trust store to a single
certificate — the exact defect this function was written to remove, arrived at from the
other direction — so that case fails loudly and leaves TLS untouched.
