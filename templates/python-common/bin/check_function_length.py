"""Cap a function or method at 60 lines of code — its docstring excluded.

WHY A HAND-ROLLED GATE. The house rule is "do not reimplement what the tool already
does", and here the tool does not do it: ruff has **no** per-function line-count rule.
``PLR0915`` (``too-many-statements``) counts *statements*, which is a different metric
and answers a different question — a function can hold 20 statements across 90 lines, or
80 statements across 80. So this is an ``ast``-based gate in the same shape as its
siblings (``check_provenance.py``, ``check_all_exports.py``): no module import, no new
dependency.

WHY THE DOCSTRING IS SUBTRACTED. This repo mandates NumPy docstrings with
``Parameters`` / ``Returns`` / ``Raises`` sections, so a raw line span measures how well a
function is **documented**, not how long it is — and a raw ceiling would punish exactly
the habit enforced everywhere else. Measured on this tree at the same 60-line ceiling:
13 Python functions exceed a raw span, **3** exceed it once the docstring is removed.
``download_daily`` (95 raw) and ``apply_dtypes`` (87 raw) *pass* — they are short,
heavily documented functions, and they are precisely the pair a raw ceiling would flag.

THE DEFINITION, stated exactly, because a gate is only as pinned as its metric
(the trap recorded in blueprintx#167, where a hand-rolled counter reported 85%
violations against standard mccabe's 8% — and which caught this file too: the first
implementation over-reported ``retry_with_backoff`` by counting its nested closures'
docstrings, so agreement with the issue's numbers was itself the bug):

- **Python** — ``node.end_lineno - node.lineno + 1``, minus **every docstring inside that
  span, nested definitions included**. ``node.lineno`` is the ``def`` line, so
  **decorators are excluded** for free. Applies to ``def``, ``async def``, and methods
  alike. Blank lines and comments inside the body DO count: they are part of what a reader
  scrolls through.

  ⚠️ The "nested included" half was WRONG in the first implementation, and it is the
  reason this file says so out loud. Subtracting only the outer docstring makes a decorator
  factory pay for its closures' documentation: ``retry_with_backoff`` measured 69 and
  "needed" a refactor, when almost all the excess was the ``decorator`` and ``wrapper``
  NumPy sections. Shortening those to get under the ceiling is documentation deleted to
  satisfy a counter — precisely the incentive the exclusion exists to remove. Corrected, it
  measures well under the limit untouched, and the tree's real count went 21 → 20.
- **Shell** — from the ``name() {`` line to the first line that is exactly ``}`` at
  column 0, inclusive. This is exact rather than heuristic **because the repo runs
  ``shfmt``**, which guarantees that shape; it deliberately avoids brace-depth counting,
  which would have to reason about braces inside strings, comments, and parameter
  expansions. Bash has no docstrings, so nothing is subtracted — the number is the number.

Every finding is a hard error (exit 1).
