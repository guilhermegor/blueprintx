"""Enforce the per-layer import policy: a vendor lives behind a seam, not in a layer.

The prose rule ("every third-party dependency is reached through a seam in ``utils/``") is
only a suggestion until something reads it. This gate reads it.

Three classifications, in order:

1. **stdlib** — always allowed, in every layer. It carries no coupling risk.
2. **first-party** — always allowed here. Direction between layers is a separate concern.
3. **third-party** — allowed only if the file's layer names it in ``allow``, WITH a reason.

Two properties are deliberate, because both are how the rule gets evaded in practice:

- **Scope is irrelevant to the verdict.** An import inside a function is judged exactly like
  one at the top of the file. Deferring an import does not undo the layer's knowledge of the
  vendor, so scope only changes where this gate has to LOOK, never what it decides. It does
  change the message, because that is the form that used to pass unnoticed.
- **A vendor may be allowed as a TYPE and denied as an API.** ``pandas`` is the vocabulary the
  layers speak: ``-> pd.DataFrame`` in a signature couples nothing, while ``pd.read_sql(...)``
  couples everything. A module under ``annotation_only`` may appear in annotations and
  nowhere else; the construction and reading live behind the ``utils/`` seams.

The policy lives in ``.layer-policy.yaml`` at the project root. No file, no gate — the check
exits 0, so a tier that has not adopted it is not blocked.

    """Return every import that points the WRONG WAY between first-party layers.

    The vendor half of this gate asks "may this layer reach outside the project?". This half
    asks the opposite question — "may this layer reach that layer?" — and they are genuinely
    different: ``utils/`` importing ``model/`` involves no vendor at all, yet it is the design
    error that turns a seam into a cycle. Both rules were prose only
    (``src/utils/CLAUDE.md``: *"utils/ is imported by them, never the reverse"*), and prose
    does not fail a build.

    ⚠️ Silent when a layer declares no ``deny_layers``. That is deliberate and is NOT the
    self-skip this gate was just fixed for: the vendor policy is deny-by-default because the
    set of vendors is open-ended, while the set of layers is small, named in the same file,
    and each project decides its own direction. An absent entry means "this layer may reach
    its siblings", which is a real answer rather than an unasked question.

    ----------

    tuple_pkg_parts : tuple of str, optional
            The file's package path below the layer root, e.g. ``("utils", "sub")``. Needed only

    list of str
