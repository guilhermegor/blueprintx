"""Enforce that a package's ``__all__`` names every public member its submodules define.

A convention that every member of a family must follow deserves an executable check, not a
doc paragraph. The usual shape of that check is an introspective test that **discovers the
family through ``__all__``** and asserts something about each member — and that shape has a
hole it cannot see: **a member missing from ``__all__`` is invisible to it.** The sweep simply
returns one fewer item, `parametrize` generates one fewer case, and the suite passes by not
looking.

Measured (filings-cvm#164): three readers registered by an anchor-replace landed in the import
block but never in ``__all__``. They were importable, unexported, and every test was green.
The sibling failure is worse: narrowing an ``__all__`` **empties** every gate that discovers
through it — 2182 → 1311 tests with no new failure, four gates silently inert.

So this walks the FILES, not the exports. For every package whose ``__init__.py`` declares
``__all__``, it collects the public module-level names its sibling submodules define and fails
on any that the list omits.

Scope is opt-in by design: a package with no ``__all__`` is not checked. Declaring an export
list is the promise; this enforces it. Reading is done with ``ast`` — never by importing —
so the gate has no side effects and needs no dependency installed.

⚠️ Discovery matching **zero** packages is a FAILURE, not a pass. A gate that scanned nothing
also found nothing wrong, and exits 0 forever the day a path is renamed.
