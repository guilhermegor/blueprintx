"""Structural gate: a migration filename must lead with a known verb (blueprintx#375).

Alembic imposes no naming convention — ``-m`` is free text. This adopts Rails'
``<verb>_<object>[_<qualifier>]`` shape: the verb is the first token, so
``ls migrations/versions/`` sorts by date and reads as a changelog on its own.
``templates/ddd-service-orm-db/alembic.ini``'s ``file_template`` (#373) already fixes the
filename to ``<date>_<rev>_<slug>.py``; this gate checks only the SLUG, decidable from the
filename alone — no interactive picker, no ``db.sh`` change (#375 leaves those undecided).

    create   drop     add      remove   rename
    change   backfill seed

``backfill``/``seed`` are their own verbs because they are NOT schema changes and cannot be
safely re-run — a reader scanning "what could have moved data" needs them to stand out.

SELF-SKIPS when ``migrations/versions/`` is absent. Only the ORM tier ships migrations today
(#373), and this script ships to every Python tier via ``python-common/bin/``.

Escape hatch, reason required, same shape as ``rmw-ok:``/``complexity-ok:`` elsewhere in this
file family — ``alembic merge`` produces a ``merge_<rev>`` slug outside the enum::

    # migration-slug-ok: <reason>

anywhere in the migration file's first few lines.
