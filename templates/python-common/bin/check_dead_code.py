"""Dead-code gate — flag only what a static tool can PROVE unreachable (blueprintx#332).

`ruff` already runs F401 (unused import) and F841 (unused local) plus the `ERA`
(commented-out code) family — this gate does not repeat either of those. It answers a
different question ruff's per-file analysis cannot see at all: a *cross-module* symbol (a
function/class/method nothing else in the whole tree calls).

Every dead-code tool is one of two mechanisms — static reachability ("does anything
reference this?") or runtime coverage ("did any execution reach this?") — and BOTH fail the
same way on a SCAFFOLD: a template's shipped seam has no caller yet, and no test yet, and
that IS the deliverable. `vulture` (the well-known Python candidate, measured here) makes
this failure mode visible as a literal cliff in its own confidence score:

    min-confidence   findings over templates/python-common/src/   (2026-09-19)
    100 / 80 / 61    2   — both real: two unused function/method parameters
    60               63  — almost all a deliberately-shipped, not-yet-called seam
                          (``mask_cnpj``, ``PATH_JSON``, …) — the entire point of a template

60 is vulture's own floor (it reports nothing lower). Above the cliff (>=80) is what the
tool can PROVE from the file alone: an assigned-but-never-read local, an unreachable branch.
At and below 60 it answers a genuinely different, CONTEXTUAL question — "does anything ELSE
in this tree call it yet?" — where "nothing yet" is the expected, correct answer for a
scaffold's unimplemented seams, and a false positive on every one of them.

So this gate is two tiers sharing one run, never two scripts:

- **>=80 confidence — GATES.** Zero cost on the template today (2 findings, both real,
  zero suppressions needed) and the same proof-strength claim holds in a generated project
  too, so it gates BOTH sides identically.
- **60-79 confidence — REPORTS, never gates.** Same tool, same run, opposite value
  depending on which side is reading it: noise on a fresh scaffold (every shipped-but-
  uncalled seam), genuine signal months into a real project (something really is
  unreferenced). Printed as a non-blocking count for a human to read manually — a per-line
  suppression scheme was rejected in blueprintx#332: it would have shipped ~60 markers per
  generated project on the seams users read first, and a marker reading "probably dead" on
  the sanctioned way to mask a CNPJ teaches the wrong thing.

Not yet wired into any tier's ``pyproject.toml``, pre-commit config, or CI (blueprintx#332
follow-up) — ``resolve_vulture`` treats an absent ``vulture`` as an expected, non-fatal skip
rather than broken discovery until that dependency lands.
