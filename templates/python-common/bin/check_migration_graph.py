"""Structural gate: the Alembic migration graph must have exactly one head (blueprintx#308).

Two PRs that each add a migration off the same base branch clean-merge Git-side — two new
files, no textual overlap, no conflict — while the *migration* graph silently branches: both
files carry the same ``down_revision``, and ``alembic upgrade head`` then fails with
"Multiple head revisions are present", discovered only when someone tries to migrate a real
database. Nothing in this repo's existing gates reads that graph; ``check_migration_slugs.py``
(#375) checks only the filename's SLUG, a different, purely textual concern.

This gate answers the one question that is decidable from the files alone, with no DB and no
``alembic`` import — read every ``revision``/``down_revision`` header via ``ast`` (never
``import`` the migration modules; they import ``alembic.op``, which is not installed on every
box that runs this gate) and check the graph it describes:

    1. **Every ``revision`` id is unique.** A collision means two files claim the same node.
    2. **Every ``down_revision`` reference resolves** to a ``revision`` that exists in the
       same ``versions/`` directory — a dangling parent is a torn-out or renamed migration.
    3. **Exactly one head.** A head is a revision nobody's ``down_revision`` points at. Two
       heads is the branched-history failure this gate exists to catch; the fix is
       ``alembic merge heads``, whose merge revision's ``down_revision`` is a TUPLE of both
       parents — this gate accepts a tuple the same way Alembic does.

SELF-SKIPS when ``migrations/versions/`` is absent or holds no revision files — only the ORM
tier ships migrations today (#373), and this script ships to every Python tier via
``python-common/bin/``. A file that exists but cannot be parsed (syntax error, no ``revision``
assignment) is NOT a skip — it is a finding: a graph gate that silently ignores what it cannot
read is exactly the "success for having checked nothing" failure this repo writes gates to
prevent.

Out of scope, deliberately (#308's own scope note): the round-trip ``upgrade``/``downgrade``
witness and the autogenerate-empty-diff check both need a live database and an installed
``alembic`` — heavier machinery than a structural graph read, and a separate follow-up.
