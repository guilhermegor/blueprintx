"""Detect a PR that weakens a quality gate without an explicit justification.

THE DEFECT (blueprintx#309). Nothing today distinguishes "fixed the code" from "deleted the
check that failed" — both produce a green PR, and this is the one failure that survives every
other control, because it disarms them. With ``required_approving_review_count`` pinned at 0
(a solo maintainer cannot self-approve, so any human gate is unsatisfiable — see
``enable_repo_rules.sh``), this has to be a deterministic gate, not a reviewer's judgement call.

WHY DIFF-SCOPED, NOT WHOLE-TREE — the one deliberate departure from this file's siblings.
``check_function_length.py`` / ``check_complexity.sh`` audit a PROPERTY of the current tree, so
whole-tree is the right shape for them. This gate audits a DELTA — a hook that was never added
is not a violation, but one that WAS there and got REMOVED is — so it has to compare against
something. It diffs the index (staged content locally; equal to HEAD on a clean CI checkout)
against ``merge-base(HEAD, <default-branch>)``, the same shape as ``check_backlog_ledger.py``.

WHAT COUNTS AS WEAKENING (every one of these is a delta, read straight off the five config
files a change touches — never off arbitrary source):

- a pre-commit hook (``- id: <x>``) removed from a changed ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``
- a rule removed from a changed ``ruff.toml``'s ``[lint] select``
- a rule ADDED to ``ignore`` or ``per-file-ignores`` — RULE level, in either config file
- a path ADDED to ``ruff.toml``'s ``exclude`` or ``mypy.ini``'s ``[mypy] exclude``
- a ``[mypy-<module>] ignore_errors = True`` section ADDED, or an EXISTING section flipped
  from ``False``/absent to ``True`` — compared by effective value, not by section presence
- an ``error:``-escalated ``filterwarnings`` entry removed from ``pytest.ini``
- a ``bin/ci/*`` file, or a ``bin/check_*``/``bin/lint_*`` gate script, DELETED
- any watched config (``.pre-commit-config.yaml``, ``ruff.toml``, ``mypy.ini``, ``pytest.ini``)
  or workflow file DELETED outright — the most complete form of every weakening above
- a job key removed from a changed workflow's ``jobs:`` block
- a required status-check context removed from ``enable_repo_rules.sh``'s
  ``REQUIRED_CHECKS`` array (the single reviewable source that WRITES the ruleset — this gate
  reads its diff rather than calling the GitHub API, the same "one implementation" reasoning
  the script itself is built on)

THE ESCAPE HATCH mirrors the precedent already in this file family (``# complexity-ok:
<reason>``): a ``gate-change-ok: <reason>`` line, with a non-empty reason, in the PR body (read
from ``GITHUB_EVENT_PATH``) or as a trailer on any commit since the merge-base — the latter
covers a local run before a PR exists, and a squash-merge that drops the PR body. A bare marker
with no reason does not count, matching ``check_complexity.sh``'s "the reason is required" rule.

⚠️ NEITHER of those two sources is reachable at the moment this gate actually FIRES locally
(blueprintx#354). The PR body needs ``GITHUB_EVENT_PATH``, live only inside a GitHub Actions
run. The trailer is read from ``git log <base>..HEAD``, and the commit this pre-commit run is
guarding is never in ``HEAD`` yet — it does not exist until the hook exits 0. The obvious third
candidate, reading the message the author is CURRENTLY typing, was measured and does not work
either: this hook runs at git's own ``pre-commit`` stage (``default_stages`` in
``.pre-commit-config.yaml``), and at that stage ``.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`` still holds the
PREVIOUS commit's message — git does not (re)write it until AFTER the pre-commit hooks pass —
and neither ``COMMIT_EDITMSG`` nor ``PRE_COMMIT_COMMIT_MSG_SOURCE`` is set in the hook's
environment at this stage (both are populated only for ``commit-msg``). So a THIRD source,
the ``GATE_CHANGE_OK`` environment variable, covers exactly that gap: it needs neither a
finished commit nor a PR, so it is live at the one moment the other two are not, and it costs
CI nothing — CI never reads a contributor's shell environment, so the PR-body/trailer path
stays the one a PR must still satisfy before it can merge. Read directly (no ``gate-change-ok:``
prefix — the variable name already says what it is), it carries the same non-empty-reason
rule, so it cannot become a quieter ``--no-verify``.

⚠️ LINE-LEVEL SUPPRESSIONS (``# noqa: X``, ``# complexity-ok: <reason>``, ``# type: ignore``,
``# pragma: no cover``, ``# shellcheck disable`` — ~250 in this tree) MUST NEVER TRIP THIS GATE,
and structurally cannot: for the config-file checks above it only ever reads the five files
named above, never a ``.py``/``.sh`` source file; for the assertion checks below it only ever
reads ``tests/{unit,integration}/test_*.py``, never an arbitrary source file where such a
suppression would live. PR #306 suppressed S608 per LINE for exactly this reason — a rule-level
ignore would have silenced every future S608 finding, not just the one reviewed. A gate that
blocked line-level suppressions would be worse than no gate: it teaches people to route around
it, and then they route around it for the real findings too.

THE SHARPER HALF (blueprintx#324): the cheapest way to turn a red build green is not a config
file at all, it is editing the assertion:

    - assert to_decimal_strict("1.999", 2) == Decimal("1.99")
    + assert to_decimal_strict("1.999", 2) == Decimal("2.00")

That diff turns a money-truncation BUG into a green suite, and nothing above this section would
object — PR #323 shipped exactly that failure in all six tiers. ⚠️ Whether "2.00" is the WRONG
answer is not decidable from a diff, and a gate that guesses is wrong in both directions. What
IS decidable is the SHAPE of the change, read only from a diff that satisfies BOTH halves of one
combination — either alone is routine, the two together are not:

- a changed ``tests/{unit,integration}/test_*.py`` file, AND
- the same branch also touches a non-test ``.py`` file sharing its module stem
  (``test_decimals.py`` <-> any ``decimals.py``) — the repo's own naming convention doubling
  as the correlation signal, never a claim about which lines are "the code under test".

Inside a file that clears that combination, four shapes count (all pure ``ast``/line-diff, no
semantic judgement):

- a ``test_*`` function present at the merge-base and gone now, or its body collapsed to a bare
  ``pass`` / ``assert True``
- a REPLACED assert line whose left-hand expression is unchanged but whose right-hand (expected)
  value changed — the #323 shape verbatim
- a REPLACED assert line whose operator weakened from ``==`` to ``in``/``>=``/``<=``/``not in``,
  or a ``self.assertEqual(`` replaced by ``self.assertTrue(`` — the #289 shape (``in`` where
  ``==`` belonged, found by a human review because nothing else was watching)
- a ``pytest.raises(<Specific>)`` replaced by a broader ``pytest.raises(Exception)`` /
  ``pytest.raises(BaseException)``, or removed outright on a line that had one
- a ``test_*`` function newly decorated ``@pytest.mark.skip`` / ``@pytest.mark.xfail`` where it
  carried no such mark at the merge-base

A test file touched WITHOUT the matching code file — a correction to a genuinely wrong
expectation, the common and legitimate case — clears none of this and must stay silent; that is
what keeps the gate payable rather than a semantic judge.

THE ESCAPE HATCH is the SAME ``gate-change-ok: <reason>`` marker as the config checks above, not
a second one. Both classes are one question — "is a change that weakens confidence in this PR's
own CI deliberate and explained?" — and a single marker means a reviewer scanning a PR body has
one phrase to look for, not two near-identical ones to tell apart. Splitting it would also
duplicate ``RE_JUSTIFICATION``/``justification_reason``/``report`` for no behavioural gain — the
kind of second implementation ``check_codespell_sync.sh`` exists to police, applied to a hatch
rather than a script.

CI must check out with ``fetch-depth: 0`` — a shallow clone has no common ancestor to resolve.

		``check_function_length.py`` / ``check_complexity.sh`` (this repo runs every shared
		gate over BlueprintX via ``--root .``); the diff itself is always repo-wide, since
		``git diff`` paths are already repository-relative regardless of cwd.
