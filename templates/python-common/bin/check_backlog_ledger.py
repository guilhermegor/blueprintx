"""Enforce the per-branch work-ledger convention structurally, not by memory.

A branch whose cumulative diff touches a **non-trivial** path must add a work ledger under
``docs/backlog/<kebab>_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`` carrying at least one ``- [ ]`` / ``- [x]`` checkbox.
It was the last rule of the flow enforced by memory in a repo that makes every other convention
structural, so it is wired into both pre-commit and CI (gate parity), like ``check_typing.py``.

Four design points that are easy to get wrong, all deliberate here:

0. **Bot PRs are exempt, keyed on the AUTHOR.** A gate demanding a human-authored artifact
   permanently blocks every bot PR that trips it — nobody can satisfy it, so the real effect is
   training people to reach for ``--admin``. The exemption reads the PR author from the event
   payload (never ``GITHUB_ACTOR``, which is whoever *triggered* the run) and fails closed when
   the author cannot be resolved. Keyed on the author and never the path: a human branch
   touching the same files still owes the ledger. See ``pr_author_login`` / ``is_bot_author``.


1. **"Non-trivial" is decided BY PATH, reusing the PR gate's classifier — but PER PATH.**
   ``pr_gate.classify_risk(list)`` returns the single *most-dangerous* class and ranks ``tests``
   above ``ci``, so a branch touching both ``bin/`` and ``tests/`` collapses to ``tests`` and would
   wrongly escape the requirement. The ledger question is *set membership* ("does ANY path fall in
   a ledger class?"), so the classifier is called **one path at a time**. Reusing it means no drift
   on what "src"/"ci" mean; asking per path means asking the right question.

2. **Diff-based, not per-commit.** The ledger is a per-*branch* artifact, so a later source-only
   commit on a branch that already has one must pass. Diff against ``merge-base(HEAD, <default>)``.
   Off a feature branch the merge-base is HEAD, the diff is empty, and this is a no-op.

3. **Diff the INDEX (``git diff --cached <base>``), not the working tree.** pre-commit runs on
   *staged* content and plain ``git diff`` ignores untracked files, so a brand-new-but-unstaged
   ledger would be invisible and the gate would demand a ledger that is sitting right there. With
   ``--cached`` the comparison sees branch commits + staged files; in CI (clean tree) it reduces to
   the branch's cumulative diff.

CI must check out with ``fetch-depth: 0`` — a shallow clone has no common ancestor to resolve.
