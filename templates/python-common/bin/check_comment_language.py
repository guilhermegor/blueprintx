r"""Keep comments and docstrings in English, while published documentation stays Portuguese.

The root ``CLAUDE.md`` draws the boundary at *documentation for a reader* × *code*: ``README.md``
and every page under ``docs/`` is Portuguese; docstrings, comments, symbol names, commit messages
and CI output are English.

⚠️ **This gate enforces only the first two of those** — comments and docstrings. Symbol names,
commit messages and CI output share the convention but are checked by nothing here, so do not
read a green run as covering them. Nothing enforced the code half at all, and it was breached
twice in one
session — first across seven ``.py`` files, then, after a sweep that grepped only ``.py``, across
five ``src/config/*.yaml`` files carrying 55 Portuguese comment lines.

Both breaches came from the same mechanism: the author read the comment *next to* the insertion
point and took it as the convention. That is why a partial sweep is worse than none — it leaves a
precedent that regenerates the violation. This gate is the part a sweep cannot be: repeatable, and
blind to which file type the last violation happened to be in.

Three design points:

1. **It looks for Portuguese function words, not for accents.** Accent-hunting flags every
   legitimate mention of ``Saídas``, ``Ativos Líquidos`` or a custodian's name; function words
   (``que``, ``não``, ``para``, ``com``, ``dos``, …) appear only when a sentence is actually being
   written in Portuguese. None of the listed words is also an English word.

2. **Quoted and backticked spans are redacted before matching.** An English comment quoting an
   e-mail subject or naming the ``saidas_zeradas`` block is correct and must pass. So are dotted
   tokens (``email_dispatch.yaml``, ``utils.text``, ``bradesco.com.br``) — without that redaction,
   ``\\bcom\\b`` matches inside every e-mail address in ``email_dispatch.yaml``.

3. **A hit is a candidate, not a verdict.** ``lang:pt-ok`` anywhere on the line skips it, for the
   case the redaction cannot reach. Mangling an English sentence to satisfy the regex would be
   worse than the hit it silences.

   ⚠️ The same restraint does **not** extend to ``TUPLE_TERMS_OF_ART``, which is empty on purpose.
   An escape marker exempts one line a reader can see; a terms-of-art entry exempts a word
   *everywhere, invisibly*. Whitelist only a term with no English equivalent — where a translation
   exists, translate. ``de-para`` was the first entry and was removed by translating its 10 sites
   to "mapping" (user decision, 2026-08-06).

Known ceiling: only **full-line** comments are read for the ``#``/``--`` file types, so a trailing
comment after a value is not checked. Reading those needs a per-format parser to tell a real
comment from a ``#`` inside a quoted value, and the measured violations were all full-line.
Python is exact regardless — it goes through ``tokenize`` and ``ast``.

**Language-agnostic by construction.** ``SET_PT_WORDS`` names the language that must NOT appear
in code; the language of ``docs/`` is never inspected, so a project whose documentation is
English, Spanish or Portuguese all use this gate unchanged. To police a different locale, swap
the word set — the redaction, block-joining and escape machinery are locale-independent.

⚠️ **The calibration IS the deliverable, not a detail.** The first draft of this gate reported
**19 findings, of which 18 were false**, and a gate that cries wolf gets switched off — at which
point it protects nothing while still looking installed. Every rule below (function words not
accents; redaction in a specific order; blocks not lines; length-preserving blanking) exists
because a specific class of false positive was measured. Do not "simplify" one away without
re-running ``tests/unit/test_comment_language_gate.py``, which pins each class by name.
