"""Structural gate: an ingested source column is never typed as a binary float.

``float64`` cannot represent most decimal fractions. A traded volume of ``1984223115.42``
is stored as ``1984223115.4200000762939453125`` — close enough to print correctly, wrong
enough that summing a session and reconciling against the exchange's published total misses by
a hair, with nothing to point at. The loss happens at ingestion, is **irreversible**, and is
**silent**: no contract check, no test of a single value, and no eyeball on a printed frame
will show it.

So this gate bans a float dtype declaration in ``src/``. The replacement is
``list_decimal_cols`` (exact :class:`decimal.Decimal`, scale preserved from the source) or
plain text; both are lossless, and a consumer can always downcast to float, whereas the
reverse is impossible.

**Escape hatch.** A genuinely dimensionless quantity with no exact decimal scale — a
statistical measure, a ratio derived by the source — may legitimately be a float. Annotate the
line and the gate accepts it::

    "SOME_RATIO": "float64",  # dtype-ok: dimensionless statistic, no exact scale

Requiring the reason in writing is the point: it turns an invisible default into a decision
someone made on purpose.
