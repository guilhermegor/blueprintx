"""Daily on-disk cache for a vendor artifact that does not change intraday.

Some sources publish once a day and then serve the same bytes until tomorrow — a regulator's
daily register, a reference table, an official CSV dump. Re-fetching one of those on every run
(or worse, once per entity) reads as scraping abuse and gets the source IP **blocked**. For a
routine whose whole purpose is to reconcile against that regulator, a block means **no runs at
all**, and it outlives the session, so nobody can simply retry.

The asymmetry is what decides it: the worst case of caching here is a one-day-stale file the
source did not change anyway; the worst case of not caching is losing access.

⚠️ **Only for a source whose data is stable for the whole reference day.** State the change
granularity in the calling reader's docstring. A source that revises intraday must not use
this — a cache cannot represent a value that moved after it was written.

⚠️ The cache is keyed by the **data's reference date**, never by wall-clock time. A run at
23:59 and one at 00:01 asking for the same reference day must hit the same file; keying on
"today" silently re-downloads at midnight and, worse, splits one logical day across two files.

**Cache policy belongs to the caller's intent, not to the client.** A scheduled drift job wants
the opposite of this module (see ``bin/check_contract_drift.py``): a cached read cannot detect
drift, and a partially-populated cache gets reported *as* drift. That is why the switch is an
explicit argument rather than an ambient default — pass ``bool_use_cache=False`` (or call
``utils.http_downloader.download_file`` directly) from any caller whose question is "did the
source change?".

	the log alone.

	Parameters
	----------
	str_url : str
		The source URL to fetch on a miss.
	path_cache_dir : pathlib.Path
		Directory the cached artifacts live in; created (parents included) on a miss rather
		than assumed to exist — the archiver may not have run yet on a fresh dated folder.
	str_key : str
		Kebab-case source name used in the cached filename.
	dt_reference : datetime.date
		The **data's** reference date, never the wall clock.
	str_suffix : str, optional
		File extension including the dot, by default ``""``.
	bool_use_cache : bool, optional
		``True`` (default) reads an existing file for this reference day. ``False`` skips the
		READ and fetches from the network — it still WRITES, refreshing the cached copy.
	cls_logger : LogEmitter, optional
		Emitter for the branch line; defaults to :class:`utils.retry.LogEmitter`.
	fn_download : Callable[[str, pathlib.Path], pathlib.Path], optional
		The download seam, by default :func:`utils.http_downloader.download_file`. Injected so
		tests never touch the network.

	Returns
	-------
	pathlib.Path
		Path to the artifact for ``dt_reference``.

	Notes
	-----
	A miss downloads into a unique staging name inside the cache directory and then renames it
	over the final path, so the file becomes visible under its cache name only once complete.
	The zero-byte guard alone is not enough: a truncated but non-empty file — disk full, a
	killed process, or another process reading while this one writes — would be served as a hit
	and reach the parser. The rename is atomic on POSIX, and on Windows for a same-filesystem
	move, which staging inside the cache directory guarantees. The staging name carries the PID
	so two concurrent downloads cannot corrupt each other; whichever finishes last wins, and
	both wrote the same day's bytes.

	A ``datetime`` is rejected explicitly even though it satisfies the ``date`` annotation: it
	is a **subclass**, so the runtime checker accepts a wall-clock value, and it formats into a
	perfectly plausible filename — the exact failure this module exists to prevent, with nothing
	downstream to complain. One reference day is one file, so the shape that silently means
	"now" cannot be allowed in.
