"""Base binding for one adapter bound to exactly one schema regime.

Part of the per-regime adapter pattern (issue #148). Motivating case (measured, not
invented): a monthly fund-profile series published 106 columns keyed ``CNPJ_FUNDO`` through
period ``202311``, then 107 columns keyed ``TP_FUNDO_CLASSE``/``CNPJ_FUNDO_CLASSE`` from
``202312`` on — the other 105 columns identical, position for position. Deriving one
contract from the other is right about 105 of 106 names and silently wrong about the one
that matters, so each regime gets its own adapter, each pinned to its own regime window
rather than to the sibling's.

This module implements only the regime-**selection** half of the pattern: which window a
period belongs to, and refusing one that does not belong to this adapter's regime. It carries
no I/O of its own — the actual file/DB read is project- and source-specific, so a concrete
per-regime reader composes or subclasses this binding instead of reimplementing the refusal
logic. Mirrors ``model.regime_reader.RegimeReader`` (mvc-service-native-db, blueprintx#289),
which implements the same shape as tier-local, DB-facing code; this copy is the layout-agnostic
version any skeleton's `utils/`/`chassis/` seam can adopt.

	"""One adapter instance bound to exactly one regime.

	Construct it with the regime's name; it refuses any period the registry resolves to a
	*different* regime, naming the one that actually covers it — so an adapter for the
	superseded schema can never silently read a period published under the new one, or vice
	versa. A ``None`` period resolves through :meth:`RegimeRegistry.default_period`, so a
	CLOSED regime's no-args default is its own newest covered period, never wall-clock
	"today".

		The registry holding every known regime window, this adapter's included.
	str_regime_name : str
		Which regime THIS adapter instance is bound to.
	int_period : int | None, optional
		The competency period, ``YYYYMM``; ``None`` resolves via
		:meth:`RegimeRegistry.default_period`.
