"""Robust tabular reading (Excel, CSV, JSON, or SQL) with dtype treatment and data contracts.

One reusable seam for turning a worksheet, a CSV, a JSON document, OR a SQL query into a
typed, validated DataFrame. File format is chosen by extension (``.csv`` → CSV with a
configurable delimiter; ``.json`` → a JSON array of records; otherwise Excel). Capabilities:

- :func:`read_table` — reads a **file**, **always** enforces its contract (raising
  :class:`ContractError` on violation), and applies explicit column types via
  :func:`utils.dtypes.apply_dtypes` (never trusting pandas' inference).
- :func:`read_query` — the **SQL** sibling: runs a parameterized query against an
  already-open DB-API connection and shares the same mandatory contract + dtype tail. The
  seam never opens connections (that stays a controller/boundary concern).
- :func:`find_file_problems` — validates a file against a contract and returns problems
  **without raising** (the boundary uses it to abort, skip, or notify).
- :func:`decode_positional_payload` — decodes an API payload whose rows are positional
  arrays beside a separate ``columns`` header, handling a row wider than its own header
  asymmetrically (drop a surplus position only when it is empty everywhere; raise when it
  holds a value). The ``.json`` reader uses it automatically for a
  ``{"columns": …, "rows": …}`` document.
- :class:`FileContract` — declares the columns a file must have and the columns that must
  hold valid CNPJs (a coercible-type check).

Column NAMES are as untrusted as column values: they are stripped at the read boundary,
because a publisher shipping ``"Symb "`` yields a column that prints as ``Symb`` while only
``df["Symb "]`` reaches it.

Bare ``pd.read_*`` is banned project-wide (ruff ``TID251``); this seam (and tests) is the one
exempt place, so every read funnels through a contract + dtype check. Projects keep their
concrete contract instances next to their models (or in ``config/contracts/``); the machinery
here stays domain-agnostic.

		Human-readable file label (used in logs and notifications).

		Source key used to route notifications (e.g. ``"cadastro"``).
	tuple_required : tuple of str

		Columns that must hold at least one valid CNPJ (coercible-type check).
	bool_full_column : bool, optional
		Whether ``tuple_required`` lists the source's **complete** published header (default
		``False``). ``tuple_required`` means "the file must contain **at least** these", so a
		contract is either a deliberate **subset** (require the keys, let the rest flow through
		as typed text) or **full-column** (generated from the whole header, the pinned-oracle
		kind). The distinction is load-bearing for the drift job: "a required column vanished
		from the source" is *always* drift, but "the source has a column we don't require" is
		drift **only** when the contract claims completeness — flagging it on a subset contract
		reports every non-required column as a finding. Keep the default ``False`` unless the
		contract was pinned to the full header; the choice should be conscious per source, not
		accidental.

	Attributes
	----------
	PROVENANCE_COLUMNS : tuple of str
		The fixed provenance columns appended to every ingested frame by
		:func:`utils.provenance.stamp_provenance`. They describe the full output shape
		(:attr:`output_columns`) but are **not** in ``tuple_required`` — that validates the
		*source* artifact, which never carries them, so the stamp is applied *after* the

	The data contract is **mandatory**: the file is always validated first and

	str_sheet : str

	int_header_row : int, optional
		Excel only: zero-based header-row index (default ``0``). Ignored otherwise.
	int_csv_quoting : int, optional
		CSV only: the :mod:`csv` quoting constant passed to the reader (default
		``csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL``, pandas' own default). Pass ``csv.QUOTE_NONE`` for external
		``;``-delimited regulatory dumps (e.g. CVM open data), where an upstream submitter's

	⚠️ Never use pandas' own JSON reader here. It infers types before anything can ask it not

	strings — measured, ``"1000.50"`` comes back as ``1000.5`` and ``"007"`` as ``7`` — so the
	"always read as text" guarantee ``read_table`` documents was false on this branch alone
	while the CSV branch honoured it. Parsing floats and ints as ``str`` keeps the exact source
	token, which is what a Decimal column is later built from.

	Parameters
	----------
	path_file : pathlib.Path
		The file to read.

		Dtype applied after decoding.
	str_encoding : str, optional
