"""Raw-artifact workspace seam (bronze-layer retention).

Every ingestion reader downloads a raw artifact from its source and parses it. Two callers
want two different things from those bytes:

- an **interactive** consumer wants a DataFrame and nothing else — the bytes are scratch and
  should leave no residue on disk;
- a **datalake** ingestion routine wants the artifact *kept*, byte-for-byte, as the bronze
  layer's authoritative record of what the source actually served.

Both are the same read with a different disposal policy, so they collapse into **one branch
in one place**. Without this seam each reader re-decides it, and the ones written under
deadline pick "scratch" — which is unrecoverable, because the source has already moved on.

Pass ``None`` and the artifact lands in a :class:`tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` destroyed on
exit; pass a path and the directory is created (parents included) and left in place, holding
the downloaded artifact and everything extracted from it.

	Parameters
	----------
	path_raw : pathlib.Path or None, optional
		Bronze-layer destination. ``None`` (the default) means the bytes are scratch: a
		temporary directory is used and destroyed on exit. A path means the artifact is
		kept — the directory is created if missing, parents included, and left in place.

	pathlib.Path
		An existing directory to write the downloaded artifact (and anything extracted
		from it) into.

	Examples
	--------
