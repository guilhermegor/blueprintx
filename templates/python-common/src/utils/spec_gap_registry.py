"""Narrow, named registry of expected spec-vs-regime column gaps.

Part of the per-regime adapter pattern (issue #148), the checklist item nothing else in the
pattern delivers: "a spec documenting only the current regime is not an oracle for the
historical one". A drift/oracle check that compares a closed regime's actual columns against
a metadata spec written for the CURRENT regime will report every column the two regimes
disagree on, forever — and the fix is never a blanket suppression of that comparison, because
that would also hide a genuinely new, unexpected mismatch the same check exists to catch.

:class:`SpecGapRegistry` narrows the suppression to exactly the ``(regime, column)`` pairs a
human has confirmed are an *expected* historical gap, named individually. Everything not
listed is reported as before — "the adapter's other oracle still running", in the issue's own
words: registering one known gap changes nothing about how any other column is checked.
