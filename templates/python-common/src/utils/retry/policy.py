    Groups "how patient to be" into one value object a caller can build once and pass down
    (e.g. a data reader forwarding it to the download seam), instead of threading five loose
    arguments. The defaults reproduce the module-level defaults, so ``RetryPolicy()`` is the
    same behaviour as an un-configured retry. It carries **only** the retry schedule — the
    per-attempt socket timeout is a download-seam concern and stays with ``download_file``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    int_max_attempts : int
            Total attempts (>= 1), by default 3 (one initial try + two retries).
    float_base_wait_s : float
            Wait before the first retry, in seconds, by default 2.0.
    float_factor : float
            Exponential growth factor; used only by the ``"exponential"`` strategy, by default 2.0.
    str_strategy : str
            Backoff schedule: ``"exponential"`` (default), ``"linear"``, or ``"constant"``.
    float_max_wait_s : float or None
            Optional per-wait cap, in seconds; ``None`` (default) leaves the schedule uncapped.
    tuple_exceptions : tuple of type[Exception]
            The transient exception types that trigger a retry, by default ``(OSError,)``.
