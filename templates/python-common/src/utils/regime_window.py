"""One schema regime's period coverage — shared, layout-agnostic value object.

Part of the per-regime adapter pattern (issue #148): a published series can change its
column set **mid-series**, under one unchanged filename pattern — each contract pinned to
its own published header, never derived from a sibling's. This value object names the
window of periods one such regime covers.

Mirrors the vocabulary of ``model.regime_window.RegimeWindow`` (mvc-service-native-db,
blueprintx#289), so a consumer that already knows that shape recognises this one — but this
copy lives in the shared ``utils/`` seam (``src/utils/`` in MVC, ``src/chassis/`` in DDD) so
any Python skeleton can adopt the pattern from one source, not just the tier it first shipped
in.
