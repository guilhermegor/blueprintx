**Fixed**:
- Issue #[Number]: [Brief description].  

<!-- CLOSING KEYWORDS — GitHub closes the issue on merge ONLY in this exact shape.
     The line above LINKS the issue; it does not close it. Add one keyword line per issue:

       Closes #12
       Closes #13

     Two traps, both measured in this repo:
       * NO colon after the keyword. `Closes: #12` / `Fixes: #12` link but never close.
       * ONE keyword PER issue. `Closes #12, #13` closes only #12 — GitHub reads just the
         first item of a comma-separated list. Repeat it: `Closes #12, Closes #13`.

     Verify the EFFECT, not the text, once the PR exists:

       gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"OWNER",name:"REPO"){pullRequest(number:N){
         closingIssuesReferences(first:20){nodes{number}}}}}' \
         --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.closingIssuesReferences.nodes[].number'

     An empty or short list means the PR closes nothing (or not everything) on merge.
     `gh pr view --json closingIssuesReferences` can serve a STALE cache right after
     `gh pr edit`; the GraphQL read above is the reliable one. -->
